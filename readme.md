# Used Car Prices

Used Car Prices is a machine learning project that uses a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho) to predict the sales price of a used car. This project has been developed for my 4th Semester Computer Science exam.

The data comes from an indian used car website called [Cardekho](https://www.cardekho.com/). It contains about 8000 rows of data from used cars from India. The data is not cleaned or preprocessed. So that will be done within the project.

## Project goals
The primary goal of this project is to use the features of the dataset to try to predict the sales price of a used car. 

The secondary goal is to find the features that are most important to predicting the fuel type of the car and using those features to predict the fuel type of a car.

## Reading the project

The project is divided into multiple notebooks and they are meant to be read in order.

1. data_preprocessing.ipynb
2. data_visualization.ipynb

At this point, the paths split up and you can read the notebooks related to selling_price or fuel_type.

Choose which path you want to go and read the notebooks as:

[selling_price] | [fuel_type]

3. model_selection.ipynb
4. model_validation.ipynb

The results will be found at the end of the model_validation notebook for each category.
